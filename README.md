# Student Voting Website

This project is a web application that facilitates an online voting system. It provides separate login pages for voters and candidates participating in the election. Each user is assigned a unique user ID and password, which are created by the admin.

## Features

### Voter Portal

- **Login:** Voters can log in using their assigned credentials.
- **Candidate List:** Once logged in, voters can view the list of candidates standing for the election.
- **Voting:** Voters can cast their vote for any one candidate. A person can vote only once. Attempts to vote again will be denied.
- **Campaign Details:** Voters can view the campaign promises and details of each candidate.
- **Feedback:** After voting, voters can leave feedback.

### Candidate Portal

- **Login:** Candidates can access their portal using their assigned user ID and password.
- **Campaign Management:** Candidates can write and manage their campaign details to inform voters about their goals and plans.

### Admin Portal

- **Profile Management:** The admin can create and manage profiles for voters and candidates.
- **User Lists:** Admins can view the list of all registered voters and candidates in real time.
- **Announcements:** An announcement feature allows admins to send notifications or updates to all registered email IDs with a single click.
- **Feedback Review:** Admins can view all feedback provided by voters.
- **Data Export:** Admins can download the voter list details for record-keeping or analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Admin Registration:** The admin creates accounts for voters and candidates, assigning unique user IDs and passwords.
2. **User Login:** Voters and candidates log in to their respective portals.
3. **Campaign & Voting:** Voters review candidate campaigns and cast their vote. Candidates manage their campaign content.
4. **Feedback & Announcements:** Voters provide feedback, and admins send announcements as needed.
5. **Data Management:** Admins monitor and manage all user profiles, feedback, and voting data efficiently.
